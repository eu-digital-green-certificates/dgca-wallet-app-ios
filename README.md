## About

This repository contains the source code of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Wallet App for iOS.

The wallet app provides a user interface to store and manage personal DGCs directly on the phone. DGCs will be imported by scanning a base45-encoded QR code and decoding CBOR to JSON. Afterwards, it is symmetrically encrypted in the app’s sandbox and the symmetric key is stored in the system’s keychain. Multiple DGCs can be stored in the app. Access to the app is controlled via biometric data (e. g., Touch ID or Face ID). The wallet app can display any imported DGC as QR code for scanning and verifying with the wallet app.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- You need a Mac to run Xcode.
- Xcode 12.5+ is used for our builds. The OS requirement is macOS 11.0+.
- To install development apps on physical iPhones, you need an Apple Developer account.
- Service Endpoints:
  - To get QR Codes for testing, you might want to check out `https://dgc.a-sit.at/ehn/testsuite`.

### Build

Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

#### Xcode based build

Important Info: SPM and the SwiftDGC [core module](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-app-core-ios)
- Depending on the development status, this module might be either linked locally or via github URL.
- If it's linked locally, you should clone both repos into the same folder:
- `<project folder>`
    - `dgca-app-core-ios`
    - `dgca-wallet-app-ios`
- Otherwise it will be pulled by Xcode like all other SPM modules.
    - Make sure the core module is up to date by clicking File > Swift Packages > Update Packages.

Build steps
- Set the development team to any Apple Developer Account
- Give the project a unique bundle identifier
- Install swift package manager requirements through Xcode 12.5+
- Build and run the project through Xcode 12.5+
